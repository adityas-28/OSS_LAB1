# Shortest Path Finder
This project is a C-based implementation of Dijkstra’s and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to compute the shortest path between two cities. It begins by reading data from a file named cities.txt, which stores city names and their respective connections with distances. The program allows users to input a source and a destination city. Using both algorithms, it calculates and displays the full path between the two, showing intermediate cities and, in the case of Dijkstra’s algorithm, the cumulative distance of the route. BFS outputs the path in terms of the minimum number of hops between cities, regardless of distance. The application provides a simple command-line interface for users to load data, input cities, and view results.

Functionally, the program includes: loadCities() to parse and load graph data from cities.txt; dijkstra() and bfs() which implement the shortest path logic using Dijkstra’s algorithm and BFS respectively; printPath() to output the result in a user-readable format; and saveToFile() to write the final computed paths to shortest_distance.txt upon exit. The user navigates through options to load the map, input cities, view paths, and export results. This tool is ideal for understanding basic graph traversal and pathfinding techniques in real-world route mapping scenarios.
